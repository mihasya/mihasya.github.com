I'm tired of Wordpress and the associated bullshit (upgrades, vulnerabilities, etc), so I'm finally ripping the bandaid off and moving my blog to a Jekyll-generated static site hosted on s3. I will not be migrating the old content, as that would be an epic pain in the ass, the benefits of which do not seem substantial to me. The old site will live on, its database and directories set to read-only mode, to serve what little google traffic still hits that blog.

**ONWARDS!**
