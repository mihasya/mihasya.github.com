title: It's a train.. no, it's a computer.. can't it be both??

I am delighted to let you spread the word about an amazing innovation from Lian
Li, the acclaimed maker of computer cases. They have thrown caution to the wind
and finally introduced the thing we've all been waiting for - the [Choo Choo
Train Computer
Case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112393).

Yes. Yes. Let that sink in. It's a computer case shaped like an old
steam-powered locomotive. It has a 300 watt power supply in the front section,
and the cart can fit a Mini ITX motherboard, a slim optical drive, and a single
internal hard drive. One might point out that these are somewhat weak specs as
far as cases go, but hey, IT'S A FUCKING TRAIN.

But wait. There's more. No, seriously, there's more.

I saw that the case had 5 star revies, so I clicked to see what proud owners had
to say about it.

Yup. Lian Li's product page for this puppy is
[epic](http://www.lian-li.com/v2/en/product/product06.php?pr_index=625&cl_index=1&sc_index=25&ss_index=62&g=spec)
Not only is there a more expensive version that moves (and comes with "Rail x6"
instead of "Rail x1"), there's a limited edition one that _has an atomizer_.
That's right. It makes steam!

Basically, I'm spent just thinking about this. The amount of space accommodated
by the case isn't ideal for the plans I have for an HTPC (I was on Newegg for a
reason, afterall), and I definitely couldn't handle "Rail x6" and a computer
case scooting back and forth, but y'all know what to get me for my birthday now.
I'll make it work.

Unfortunately, it's out of stock on NewEgg and I can't find it for sale
anywhere, so I fear that the opportunity may have passed. Who knows when Lian Li
will elect to share their genius with us again? I'll probably end up having to
purchase one of these guys on Ebay for thousands of dollars as a collectors item
years from now.
