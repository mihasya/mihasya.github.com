It is becoming increasingly plausible that I have a partially torn miniscus in my left knee. The unusual, difficult to place pain, the occasional painful popping and "catching" in the joint, the frequent unprompted discomfort.. I run into people on a regular basis playing soccer - any number of recent collisions could damage a ligament.

But the ligament is not the issue.

The issue is the reluctance to call it what it is - the orthopedic sugeon dictated _"possible meniscus irregularity"_ into his recorder. The physical therapist opted for the cautious _"possibility of some miniscus involvement."_ Having already been primed, I pressed a bit: "A torn miniscus, you mean?" "Yes, a partial tear."

Come on guys, I'm not going to _die_ of a torn miniscus. The upper bound on recovery from a miniscus repair is 4 months, and I'm 26 - it would likely take less than that. Surely they don't expect me to break down crying right there in the office when confronted with the news..

Why am I writing about this harmless, albeit frustrating, experience? I do have a reason: it reminded me of a [great piece The Economist ran on the subject of "euphemisms" last December](http://www.economist.com/node/21541767). It is particularly relevant in the current political climate, especially the very last section titled "Little white lies."

The piece ends with a call to abandon euphemisms for a day. I highly recommend this exercise, having lived it long before this article was published. You'll piss some people off, but at least they (and you) will know where you stand.
